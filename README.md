My name is Desire Asinya and I am a junior at Washington and Lee University. I am a computer science major and a math minor, and my interests are in Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence. I am currently working on an iOS app development course with CodePath and have worked on less sophisticated projects such as building a basic webpage with HTML/CSS, writing a web-scraping script, and coding games such as tic-tac-toe and hangman. I am actively searching for Software Engineering internship positions, so feel free to message me at asinyadesire10@gmail.com with any recommendations. Outside coding, my favorite hobbies are watching soccer and playing video games. I also enjoy going on walks. Fun fact: I have been to the top of the Athenian acropolis before.
